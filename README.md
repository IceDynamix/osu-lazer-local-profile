# osu! lazer local profile

i mean its basically what it says. it takes your local scores on ranked maps and shows them.

oh yeah this is for lazer, not stable btw

colored by recency, 1d/1w/1m/rest

`dotnet run <lazer dir> <osu/taiko/catch/mania>`

if you include an [api key for osu daily](https://github.com/Adrriii/osudaily-api/wiki) then it will also retrieve the estimated rank for you
